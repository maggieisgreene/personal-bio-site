    <p id="aboutMe">Welcome, my name is Maggie and this is a rough draft. I am a model turned software developer from Nashville, Tennessee. For the past three years, I have lived between New York City, Los Angeles, and London while traveling elsewhere for work. Modeling has given me a sense of independence, knowledge of real world problem solving, and some of the best memories of my life. However, for these past three years, I have longed to grow intellectually besides reading books on airplanes and keeping up with the news. 
For as long as I can remember, I have been interested in coding. The complexity and power of what looks somewhat like gibberish to the outside world ignited interest immediately. The idea that you could make something from nothing, and not just something, something great. When I heard about NSS I knew it was the path I was going to take, and I am eternally grateful for the opportunity they have given me. From the first week of class and ever since, I have been passionate about writing code that makes something great. Now, I code. Whatâ€™s your super power?
